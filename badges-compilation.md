## Reflections

1. **Module 1** introduced me to the TypeScript language. It gave me overview of TypeScript features and understanding of reelationships between TS and JS.

2. **Module 2** expanded my understanding of the JS and TS languages. Until now I haven't thought about type systems of languages, But after studying this module. I understood the intricacies and problems of JS dynamic type sistem. I also learned diffirent basic types in TS and how do I work with them.

3. In **Module 3** I learned what interfaces are, when to use them, how to extend them. I also learned about property types (readonly, required and optional).

4. In **Module 4** I learned how to convert a JS function to TypeScript strong type parameters. Also i improve my understanding of difference between function expression, declaration and arrow func due to this module.

5. **Module 5** is the place, where you dip deep learning this task. Even in JS Classes isn't easy topic and the TS classes makes things more complexity. But luckely for students **Module 5** gives you understanding nice and slowly. Due to this module I learned how to work with Classes in TS and fixed a knowledge gap with the topic modifiers.

6. **Module 6** introduced me to the **generics**. Generics are flexible code templates that can work on a variety of data. At first glance they are complex and incomprehensible, but with a closer look they are very useful when we work with a variety of data types. When I first started learning TS I was afraid that I would have to use type `any` when I face a variety of data types. But after learning this module I can say with confidence that there will be no `any` in my future TS projects.

7. In **Module 7** I learned how to organize code using modules in TypeScript. This is very similar on JS modules but with slight differences.

8. **Module 8** extends Module 7 but about namespaces, not modules. It's interesting and informative module, but in my opinion namespaces are outdated featue. In essence,namespaces are just usual classes with a private methods and fields, but dedicated to a separate feature.
